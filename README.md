## 🐷 Pig Game

Pig is a simple, fun, turn-based dice game for two or more players. The goal is to be the first to reach 100 points.

### 🎲 How to Play

- Players take turns rolling a single six-sided die.
- On each turn, a player can roll as many times as they like to accumulate points.
- Each roll adds its value to the player’s **turn total**, unless a **1** is rolled.
- Rolling a **1** ends the turn immediately and the player **loses all points earned during that turn**.
- At any point during their turn, a player can choose to **"hold"**, which adds their turn total to their **overall score** and passes the turn to the next player.

### 🏆 Winning

The first player to reach **100 points** or more wins the game.
